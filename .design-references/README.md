# Design References

This folder contains design references, mockups, and visual guidelines for the Webflow SEO Alt Text Tool UI.

## Purpose

- Screenshots of reference designs (Discord, Linear, etc.)
- Mockups or wireframes  
- Color palette examples
- Typography samples
- Component design examples
- Layout sketches

## Supported Formats

- Images: PNG, JPG, WebP
- Design files: Figma exports, Sketch exports
- Documents: Markdown, text files with design notes

## How to Use

1. Paste your design reference files into this folder
2. Let Claude know which files to reference (e.g., "Look at mockup.png in .design-references")
3. Claude will read the files and implement the UI to match

**Note:** This folder is gitignored by default to avoid committing large design files. If you want to commit specific references, update `.gitignore`.
